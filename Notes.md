# Notes
### why use Body-parser?
- When a client sends data to the server via a POST or PUT request, the data is sent in the request body. This data could be in various formats such as JSON, URL-encoded, or multipart form data.
- **body-parser is a middleware for Express.js that parses the request body and makes it available under the req.body property. It can parse different types of request bodies, including JSON, URL-encoded, and multipart form data.**
